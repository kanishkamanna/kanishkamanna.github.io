## Welcome!

My name is Kanishka and I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Nevada Bioinformatics Center](https://www.unr.edu/bioinformatics/contact/kanishka-manna) at the **University of Nevada, Reno**. My research interest is multi-omics research. I am passionate about bridging biology and bioinformatics by combining analytical rigor with creative problem-solving to address complex biological questions. My expertise spans proteogenomics, next-generation omics, and microbiome research. In my work, I routinely apply computational and statistical methods to uncover novel biological mechanisms, identify biomarkers, and enhance our understanding of the systems biology. 

I completed my _Ph.D._ in _Bioinformatics_ with _Dr. Stephanie Byrum_ at the **University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR)** and the **University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS)**. My doctoral research centered on developing a reproducible workflow for proteogenomics research by integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data. Before that, I earned both my _M.Sc._ and _B.Sc._ degrees in _Microbiology_ from **Vijaygarh Jyotish Ray College**, affiliated with the University of Calcutta.

When I am not in the lab, you can find me enjoying a wide variety of outdoor activities, especially hiking and camping. I also have a deep passion for watercolor illustrations and photography.
