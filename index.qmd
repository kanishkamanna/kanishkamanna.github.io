## Welcome!

My name is Kanishka *(Kuh-nish-ka)*. I am a Bioinformatics Scientist who lives at the intersection between big data and biology. I'm interested in applying concepts from computer and data science in bioinformatics and beyond! I believe in open science, open source software, and reproducible data analysis. 

I graduated with a PhD. (Bioinformatics) from the Joint Bioinformatics Program at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock (UALR) and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). My Doctoral research focused on the development of a reproducible pipeline for multi-omics research through curation, integration and annotation of biological big data. I'm an incoming Postdoctoral Scholar in the Nevada Bioinformatics Center at the University of Nevada, Reno. 

Outside of work, I'm an avid hiker, backcountry backpacker and an amateur watercolor illustrator.
