Hi there, I'm Kanishka! A Bioinformatics Scientist who lives at the intersection between big data and biology. I'm interested in applying concepts from computer and data science in bioinformatics and beyond! I believe in open science, open source software, and reproducible data analysis. I'm an incoming Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Nevada, Reno. I graduated with a PhD. (Bioinformatics) from the Joint Bioinformatics Program at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock (UALR) and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). My Doctoral research focused on the development of a reproducible pipeline for multi-omics research through curation, integration and annotation of biological big data. Outside of work, I'm an avid hiker, backcountry backpacker and an amateur watercolor illustrator.
