Hello! I am a future Bioinformatician.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at the University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR) and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) in the US. Before that, I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Microbiology at Vijaygarh Jyotish Ray College (affiliated to the University of Calcutta) in India. During my master's, I followed my passion for biochemistry and molecular biology, and did my thesis on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) from the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in India. It is there I also did a short-term internship at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Transitioning from experimental lab to computer science role was not an easy feat, but I'm glad I did! Back in 2017, I had a chance to attend a seminar by Dr. Mary-Claire King, it was there I got acquainted with the world of computational biology and later took a course in my master's on Bioinformatics. This intensified my passion for research and motivated to pursue a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics.

Presently, I am developing a pipeline for detecting proteoforms (protein isoforms) in multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics) data in the laboratory of Dr. Stephanie D. Byrum. My bioinformatics skill set includes: analysis of NGS, proteomics, post-translation modifications, metagenomics datasets, microbial genomics, pathway enrichment, biostatistics, custom database creation, development of pipelines/tools and applying machine learning algorithms to analyze biological big data. My future research interests includes but not limited to neo-antigen discovery using single-molecule sequencing of the proteome, metabolomics and spatial multi-omics techniques. My main passion and career goal is to bridge the gap between biology and bioinformatics, by knowledge sharing; and I try to contribute by sharing my code, tutorials and notes.

I feel very fortunate to be doing so many things that I love a lot right now. That includes my work, but also spending a lot of time outdoors. Mountains have always hold a special place in my heart ever since my Dad introduce me to trekking in the foothills of the Himalayas. And over the years, my love for hiking/trekking is going stronger. Most of my free time is now spent on the trails. Other than spending time outdoors, I recently have pick up the hobby to illustrate nature and science related topics using watercolor technique.

This website is an introduction to who I am, providing a summary of my background, my research and my hobbies. Thank you!
