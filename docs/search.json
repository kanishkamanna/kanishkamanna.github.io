    "text": "Hello! I am a future Bioinformatician.\nCurrently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Ph.D.Â in Bioinformatics at the University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR) and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) in the US. Before that, I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Microbiology at Vijaygarh Jyotish Ray College (affiliated to the University of Calcutta) in India. During my masterâ€™s, I followed my passion for biochemistry and molecular biology, and did my thesis on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) from the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in India. It is there I also did a short-term internship at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Transitioning from experimental lab to computer science role was not an easy feat, but Iâ€™m glad I did! Back in 2017, I had a chance to attend a seminar by Dr.Â Mary-Claire King, it was there I got acquainted with the world of computational biology and later took a course in my masterâ€™s on Bioinformatics. This intensified my passion for research and motivated to pursue a Ph.D.Â in Bioinformatics.\nPresently, I am developing a pipeline for detecting proteoforms (protein isoforms) in multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics) data in the laboratory of Dr.Â Stephanie D. Byrum. My bioinformatics skill set includes: analysis of NGS, proteomics, post-translation modifications, metagenomics datasets, microbial genomics, pathway enrichment, biostatistics, custom database creation, development of pipelines/tools and applying machine learning algorithms to analyze biological big data. My future research interests includes neo-antigen discovery using single-molecule sequencing of the proteome, metabolomics and spatial multi-omics techniques. My main passion and career goal is to bridge the gap between biology and bioinformatics, by knowledge sharing; and I try to contribute by sharing my code, tutorials and notes.\nI feel very fortunate to be doing so many things that I love a lot right now. That includes my work, but also spending a lot of time outdoors. Mountains have always hold a special place in my heart ever since my Dad introduce me to trekking in the foothills of the Himalayas. And over the years, my love for hiking/trekking is going stronger. Most of my free time is now spent on the trails. Other than spending time outdoors, I recently have pick up the hobby to illustrate nature and science related topics using watercolor technique.\nThis website is an introduction to who I am, providing a summary of my background, my research and my hobbies. Thank you!"

Previously, we reported that obesity can change gut microbiota using the Zucker rat model. Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent approved by the FDA to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adults and children older than 10 years of age. The correlation of short-term metformin treatment and specific alterations to the gut microbiota in obese models is less known. Short-term metformin has been shown to reduce liver steatosis. Here we investigate the effects of short-term metformin treatment on population of gut microbiota profile in an obese rat model. Five week old obese (n = 12) female Zucker rats after 1 week of acclimation, received AIN-93 G diet for 8 weeks and then rats were randomly assigned into two groups (6 rats/group): (1) obese without metformin (ObC), or (2) obese with metformin (ObMet). Metformin was mixed with AIN-93G diet at 1,000 mg/kg of diet. Rats were weighed twice per week. All rats were sacrificed at the end of metformin treatment at 10 weeks and fecal samples were collected and kept at âˆ’80Â°C. Total microbial DNA was collected directly from the fecal samples used for shotgun-metagenomics sequencing and subsequently analyzed using MetaPlAn and HUMAnN. After stringent data filtering and quality control we found significant differences (p = 0.0007) in beta diversity (Aitchison distances) between the ObC vs.Â ObMet groups. Supervised and unsupervised analysis of the log-ratios Bacteroides dorei and B. massiliensis vs.Â all other Bacteroides spp., revealed that B. dorei and B. massiliensis were enriched in the ObMet group, while the remaining Bacteroides spp. where enriched in the ObC group (p = 0.002). The contributional diversity of pathways is also significantly associated by treatment group (p = 0.008). In summary, in the obese Zucker rat model, short-term metformin treatment changes the gut microbiota profile, particularly altering the composition Bacteroides spp. between ObC and ObMet.\n\n\n\nAssociated Publication: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.834776\n\n\n\n2021 - 2022\n\nProteogenomics analysis to identify acquired resistance-specific alterations in melanoma PDXs on MAPKi therapy\nbioRxiv (Preprint)\nAbstract: Therapeutic approaches to treat melanoma include small molecule drugs that target activating protein mutations in pro-growth signaling pathways like the MAPK pathway. While beneficial to the approximately 50% of patients with activating BRAFV600 mutation, mono- and combination therapy with MAPK inhibitors is ultimately associated with acquired resistance. To better characterize the mechanisms of MAPK inhibitor resistance in melanoma, we utilize patient-derived xenografts and apply proteogenomic approaches leveraging genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic technologies that permit the identification of resistance-specific alterations and therapeutic vulnerabilities. A specific challenge for proteogenomic applications comes at the level of data curation to enable multi-omics data integration. Here, we present a proteogenomic approach that uses custom curated databases to identify unique resistance-specific alternations in melanoma PDX models of acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance. We demonstrate this approach with a NRASQ61L melanoma PDX model from which resistant tumors were developed following treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Our multi-omics strategy addresses current challenges in bioinformatics by leveraging development of custom curated proteogenomics databases derived from individual resistant melanoma that evolves following MEK inhibitor treatment and is scalable to comprehensively characterize acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance across patient-specific models and genomic subtypes of melanoma.\n\n\n\nAssociated Publication: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.480454v1.full (first author)\n\n\n\n2020 - 2021\n\nMulti-omics data integration reveals correlated regulatory features of triple negative breast cancer\nMolecular omics\nAbstract: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer with very little treatment options. TNBC is very heterogeneous with large alterations in the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscapes leading to various subtypes with differing responses to therapeutic treatments. We applied a multi-omics data integration method to evaluate the correlation of important regulatory features in TNBC BRCA1 wild-type MDA-MB-231 and TNBC BRCA1 5382insC mutated HCC1937 cells compared with non-tumorigenic epithelial breast MCF10A cells. The data includes DNA methylation, RNAseq, protein, phosphoproteomics, and histone post-translational modification. Data integration methods identified regulatory features from each omics method that had greater than 80% positive correlation within each TNBC subtype. Key regulatory features at each omics level were identified distinguishing the three cell lines and were involved in important cancer related pathways such as TGFÎ² signaling, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. We observed overexpression of PTEN, which antagonizes the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and MYC, which downregulates the same pathway in the HCC1937 cells relative to the MDA-MB-231 cells. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways are both downregulated in HCC1937 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 cells, which likely explains the divergent sensitivities of these cell lines to inhibitors of downstream signaling pathways. The DNA methylation and RNAseq data is freely available via GEO GSE171958 and the proteomics data is available via the ProteomeXchange PXD025238.\n\n\n\n\nAssociated Publication: https://doi.org/10.1039/D1MO00117E (first author)"
