    "text": "I am a Bioinformatics PhD candidate at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). My research focuses on multi-omics, epigenetics and microbiome. Currently, I am developing a proteogenomics pipeline for the detection of proteoforms. I am passionate about bridging the gap between biology and bioinformatics, having worked in both experimental lab and computer science roles. When I am not busy detecting bugs, you can find me outside on a trail or camping.\nThis website is an introduction to who I am, providing a summary of my background and my research."
