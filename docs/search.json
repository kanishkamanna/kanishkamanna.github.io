    "text": "Hello! I am a future Bioinformatician.\nCurrently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Ph.D.Â in Bioinformatics at the University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR) and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) in the US. Before that, I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Microbiology at Vijaygarh Jyotish Ray College (affiliated to the University of Calcutta) in India. During my masterâ€™s, I followed my passion for biochemistry and molecular biology, and did my thesis on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) from the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in India. It is there I also did a short-term internship at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Transitioning from experimental lab to computer science role was not an easy feat, but Iâ€™m glad I did! Back in 2017, I had a chance to attend a seminar by Dr.Â Mary-Claire King, it was there I got acquainted with the world of computational biology and later took a course in my masterâ€™s on Bioinformatics. This intensified my passion for research and motivated to pursue a Ph.D.Â in Bioinformatics.\nPresently, I am developing a pipeline for detecting proteoforms (protein isoforms) in multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics) data in the laboratory of Dr.Â Stephanie D. Byrum. My bioinformatics skill set includes: analysis of NGS, proteomics, post-translation modifications, metagenomics datasets, microbial genomics, pathway enrichment, biostatistics, custom database creation, development of pipelines/tools and applying machine learning algorithms to analyze biological big data. My future research interests includes neo-antigen discovery using single-molecule sequencing of the proteome, metabolomics and spatial multi-omics techniques. My main passion and career goal is to bridge the gap between biology and bioinformatics, by knowledge sharing; and I try to contribute by sharing my code, tutorials and notes.\nI feel very fortunate to be doing so many things that I love a lot right now. That includes my work, but also spending a lot of time outdoors. Mountains have always hold a special place in my heart ever since my Dad introduce me to trekking in the foothills of the Himalayas. And over the years, my love for hiking/trekking is going stronger. Most of my free time is now spent on the trails. Other than spending time outdoors, I recently have pick up the hobby to illustrate nature and science related topics using watercolor technique.\nThis website is an introduction to who I am, providing a summary of my background, my research and my hobbies. Thank you!"

Transitioning from experimental lab to data science role was not an easy feat, but I am glad that I made the journey! Back in 2017, I attended a seminar on cancer presented by Dr.Â Mary-Claire King, it was there I got acquainted with genomics and bioinformatics. This intensified my passion for research in biochemistry and motivated me to dive into the world of computational biology and bioinformatics, specifically the analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) based multi-omics data.\nAs part of my doctoral research, I developed a reproducible proteogenomics pipeline that can generate custom protein sequence databases by integrating, curating and annotating multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics) data. These custom protein sequence databases can then be leveraged primarily to detect novel proteoforms (protein isoforms) downstream in-conjunction with proteomics data. My research goals are to analyze various -omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) and developing new scientific software and methods for analyzing these kinds of data. This means Iâ€™m dependent on others sharing their data, and proudly consider myself a research parasite. I believe in open science, open source software and reproducible data analysis.\nI feel very fortunate to be doing so many things that I love a lot right now. That includes my work, but also spending a lot of time outdoors. Mountains have always hold a special place in my heart ever since my father introduce me to hiking in the Himalayas. And over the years, I have piqued new interests in backcountry camping, rock climbing along with hiking; my love for these sports keep growing stronger. Most of my free time is now spent on trails.
